# Django Projects
Here are my first attempts at learning Django. I'm following 2 tutorials-

* a polls voting site following tutorials from the main Django site, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/
* then following the all powerful testing goat in "Test-Driven Web Development with Python", http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc
* I'm also learning more about using .git bashes. This is kind of confusing so please bear with me!
